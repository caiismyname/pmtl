## A Discussion on Early-Career Product Management

I had the pleasure of recording a conversation with [Diego Granados (PM at Microsoft)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegogranadoshernandez/) for his [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzpDM7pbVBxV1WwjYux0Ixw). We cover the whole gamut of my product management career thus far, starting from my roots as a CS student who found his way into product management by way of a side project, what my role looks like now as an Associate Product Manager (APM), and some of our thoughts on how best to position yourself when trying to land an APM role and start your PM career.

This was a wonderful conversation that I thoroughly enjoyed, and I hope you do too. A big thank you to Diego for having me on â€” [go subscribe to his channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzpDM7pbVBxV1WwjYux0Ixw) for more content like this!
